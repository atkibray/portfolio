            <!-- <p>
                Before coming to college, I had very little knowledge of what the world of coding had to offer. I had a little experience
                in Java coding simple plugins for a multi-platform game called Minecraft, but nothing complex. I did, however, recognize
                my expanding interest in the details behind the code. This passion kept evolving throughout highschool and ultimately determined
                my college major.

                                Since coming to Iowa State I have learned how to work in teams, create games, create websites and ultimately
                                the ins and outs of enterprise level programs. Beyond substantial improvements in my knowlege of Java, I have also
                                studied and worked with:
                                <ul>

                                Given that Java is the most sought-out programming language by hiring managers in the Americas, these are the the areas
                                that I have studied and become proficient in:
                                <ul>

                has to offer to me.

                                This website was a project for Software Engineering 319: Construction of User Interefaces at Iowa State University.
                                The idea was to develop a single web page using only two languages: HTML and CSS. The specifications were to create
                                a menu at the top, also known as the navigation bar. The buttons within the navigation bar, when clicked, will direct
                                the user to that section of the web page. We also created a footer, containers and were required to have images present.
                                The project was fairly simple, and this web page has been expanded to resemble a real example of an online portfolio.

                            <p>
                                Kill Bill is a 2D rogue-like dungeon crawler game that was designed and created as a software engineering project.
                                In the game, you take on the role of Bill Gates' ex-wife (Melinda), you gather items and fight enemies in various 
                                rooms of a tower with the ultimate goal of reaching the top and beating the boss, Bill Gates himself. You begin with 
                                a starting weapon and earn loot boxes as you eliminate the enemies in each room. Do you have what it takes to... Kill Bill?
                                <br><br>
                                Kill Bill was developed in Java using a lightweight game engine called LibGDX. The game utilizes a variety of different file
                                types, such as: Java files, images, audio files and map files.
